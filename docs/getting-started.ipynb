    "# Getting started with Xanthus\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Xanthus?\n",
    "\n",
    "Xanthus is a Neural Recommender package written in Python. It started life as a personal project to take an academic ML paper and translate it into a 'production-ready' software package and to replicate the results of the paper along the way. It uses Tensorflow 2.0 under the hood, and makes extensive use of the Keras API. If you're interested, the original authors of [the paper that inspired this project](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3038912.3052569) provided code for their experiments, and this proved valuable when starting this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, while it is great that they provided their code, the repository isn't maintained, the code uses an old versions of Keras (and Theano!), it can be a little hard for beginners to get to grips with, and it's very much tailored to produce the results in their paper. All fair enough, they wrote a great paper and published their workings. Admirable stuff. Xanthus aims to make it super easy to get started with the work of building a neural recommendation system, and to scale the techniques in the original paper (hopefully) gracefully with you as the complexity of your applications increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through a basic example of using Xanthus to predict previously unseen movies to a set of users using the classic 'Movielens' recommender dataset. The [original paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3038912.3052569) tests the architectures in this paper as part of an _implicit_ recommendation problem. You'll find out more about what this means later in the notebook. In the meantime, it is worth remembering that the examples in this notebook make the same assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready for some code?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading a sample dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah, the beginning of a brand new ML problem. You'll need to download the dataset first. You can use the Xanthus `download.movielens` utility to download, unzip and save your Movielens data."

    "### Leave one out protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any ML model, it is important to keep a held-out sample of your dataset to evaluate your model's performance. This is naturally important for recommenders too. However, recommenders differ slightly in that we are often interested in the recommender's ability to _rank_ candidate items in order to surface the most relevant content to a user. Ultimately, the essence of recommendation problems is search, and getting relevant items in the top `n` search results is generally the name of the game -- absolute accuracy can often be a secondary consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common way of evaluating the performance of a recommender model is therefore to create a test set by sampling `n` items from each user's `m` interactions (e.g. movie ratings), keeping `m-n` interactions in the training set and putting the 'left out' `n` samples in the test set. The thought process then goes that when evaluating a model on this test set, you should see the model rank the 'held' out samples more highly in the results (i.e. it has started to learn a user's preferences). \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'leave one out' protocol is a specific case of this approach where `n=1`. Concretely, when creating a test set using 'leave one out', you withold a single interaction from each user and put these in your test set. You then place all other interactions in your training set. To get you going, Xanthus provides a utility function called -- funnily enough -- `leave_one_out` under the `evaluate` subpackage. You can import it and use it as follows:"

    "You'll notice that there's a couple of things going on here. Firstly, the function returns the input interactions frame (in this case `ratings`) and splits it into the two datasets as expected. Fair enough. We then have two keyword arguments `shuffle` and `deduplicate`. The argument `shuffle` will -- you guessed it -- shuffle your dataset before sampling interactions for your test set. This is set to `True` by default, so it is shown here for the purpose of being explicit. The second argument is `deduplicate`. This does what you might expect too -- it strips any cases where a user interacts with a specific item more than once (i.e. a given user-item pair appears more than once).\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, the `leave_one_out` function is really a specific version of a more general 'leave `n` out' approach to splitting a dataset. There's also other ways you might want to split datasets for recommendation problems. For many of those circumstances, Xanthus provides a more generic `split` function. This was inspired by Azure's [_Recommender Split_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/split-data-using-recommender-split#:~:text=The%20Recommender%20Split%20option%20is,user%2Ditem%2Drating%20triples) method in Azure ML Studio. There are a few important tweaks in the Xanthus implementation, so make sure to check out that functions documentation if you're interested.\n",

    "## Introducing the `Dataset`\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other ML problems, recommendation problems typically need to create encoded representations of a domain in order to be passed into a model for training and evaluation. However, there's a few aspects of recommendation problems that can make this problem particularly fiddly. To help you on your way, Xanthus provides a few utilities, including the `Dataset` class and the `DatasetEncoder` class. These structures are designed to take care of the fiddliness for you. They'll build your input vectors (including with metadata, if you provide it -- more on that later) and sparse matrices as required. You shouldn't need to touch a thing. \n",

    "Let's unpack what's going on here. The `Dataset` class provides the `from_df` class method for quickly constructing a `Dataset` from a 'raw' Pandas `DataFrame`. You want to create a train and test dataset, hence creating two separate `Dataset` objects using this method. Next, you can see that the `encoder` keyword argument is passed in to the `from_df` method. This ensures that each `Dataset` maintains a reference to the _same_ `DatasetEncoder` to ensure consistency when used. The final argument here is `normalize`. This expects a callable object (e.g. a function) that scales the `rating` column (if provided). In the case of this example, the normalization is simply to treat the ratings as an implicit recommendation problem (i.e. all zero or one). The `utils.as_implicit` function simply sets all ratings to one. Simple enough, eh?\n",

The idea is that you evaluate your model on the user-item pairs in your test set, and for each 'true' user-item pair, you sample `n_samples` negative instances for that user (i.e. items they haven't interacted with). In the case of the `create_rankings` function, this produces and array of shape `n_users, n_samples + 1`. Concretely, for each user, you'll get an array where the first element is a positive sample (something they _did_ interact with) and `n_samples` negative samples (things they _did not_ interact with). \n",
