    "## What is Xanthus?\n",
    "\n",
    "Xanthus is a Neural Recommender package written in Python. It started life as a personal project to take an academic ML paper and translate it into a 'production-ready' software package and to replicate the results of the paper along the way. It uses Tensorflow 2.0 under the hood, and makes extensive use of the Keras API. If you're interested, the original authors of [the paper that inspired this project]() provided code for their experiments, and this proved valuable when starting this project. However, while it is great that they provided their code, the repository isn't maintained, the code uses an old versions of Keras (and Theano!), it can be a little hard for beginners to get to grips with, and it's very much tailored to produce the results in their paper. All fair enough, they wrote a great paper and published their workings. Admirable stuff. Xanthus aims to make it super easy to get started with their work, and to scale their techniques (hopefully) gracefully with you as the complexity of your applications increase.\n",

    "### Leave one out protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any ML model, it is important to keep a held-out sample of your dataset to evaluate your model's performance. This is naturally important for recommenders too. However, recommenders differ slightly in that we are often interested in the recommender's ability to _rank_ candidate items in order to surface the most relevant content to a user. Ultimately, the essence of recommendation problems is search, and getting relevant items in the top `n` search results is generally the name of the game -- absolute accuracy can often be a secondary consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common way of evaluating the performance of a recommender model is therefore to create a test set by sampling `n` items from each user's `m` interactions (e.g. movie ratings), keeping `m-n` interactions in the training set and putting the 'left out' `n` samples in the test set. The thought process then goes that when evaluating a model on this test set, you should see the model rank the 'held' out samples more highly in the results (i.e. it has started to learn a user's preferences). \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'leave one out' protocol is a specific case of this approach where `n=1`. Concretely, when creating a test set using 'leave one out', you withold a single interaction from each user and put these in your test set. You then place all other interactions in your training set. To get you going, Xanthus provides a utility function called -- funnily enough -- `leave_one_out` under the `evaluate` subpackage. You can import it and use it as follows:"

    "You'll notice that there's a couple of things going on here. Firstly, the function returns the input interactions frame (in this case `ratings`) and splits it into the two datasets as expected. Fair enough. We then have two keyword arguments `shuffle` and `deduplicate`. The argument `shuffle` will -- you guessed it -- shuffle your dataset before sampling interactions for your test set. This is set to `True` by default, so it is shown here for the purpose of being explicit. The second argument is `deduplicate`. This does what you might expect too -- it strips any cases where a user interacts with a specific item more than once (i.e. a given user-item pair appears more than once).\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, the `leave_one_out` function is really a specific version of a more general 'leave `n` out' approach to splitting a dataset. There's also other ways you might want to split datasets for recommendation problems. For many of those circumstances, Xanthus provides a more generic `split` function. This was inspired by Azure's [_Recommender Split_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/split-data-using-recommender-split#:~:text=The%20Recommender%20Split%20option%20is,user%2Ditem%2Drating%20triples) method in Azure ML Studio.

    "## Introducing the `Dataset`\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other ML problems, recommendation problems typically need to create encoded representations of a domain in order to be passed into a model for training and evaluation. However, there's a few aspects of recommendation problems that can make this problem particularly fiddly. To help you on your way, Xanthus provides a few utilities, including the `Dataset` class and the `DatasetEncoder` class. These structures are designed to take care of the fiddliness for you. They'll build your input vectors (including with metadata, if you provide it -- more on that later) and sparse matrices as required. You shouldn't need to touch a thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works. First, your 'train' and 'test' datasets are going to need to share the same encodings, right? Otherwise they'll disagree on whether `Batman Forever (1995)` shares the same encoding across the datasets, and that would be a terrible shame. To create your `DatasetEncoder` you can do this:"

    "Let's unpack what's going on here. The `Dataset` class provides the `from_df` class method for quickly constructing a `Dataset` from a 'raw' Pandas `DataFrame`. You want to create a train and test dataset, hence creating two separate `Dataset` objects using this method. Next, you can see that the `encoder` keyword argument is passed in to the `from_df` method. This ensures that each `Dataset` maintains a reference to the _same_ `DatasetEncoder` to ensure consistency when used. The final argument here is `normalize`. This expects a callable object (e.g. a function) that scales the `rating` column (if provided). In the case of this example, the normalization is simply to treat the ratings as an implicit recommendation problem (i.e. all zero or one). The `utils.as_implicit` function simply sets all ratings to one. Simple enough, eh?\n",

    "What is going on here, you ask? Good question. First, you import the `GeneralizedMatrixFactorizationModel` as any other object. You then define `fit_params` -- fit parameters -- to define the training loop used by the Keras optimizer. All Xanthus neural recommender models inherit from the base `NeuralRecommenderModel` class. By default, this class (and therefore all child classes) utilize the `Adam` optimizer. You can configure this to use any optimizer you wish though!\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `fit_param`, the `GeneralizedMatrixFactorizationModel` is initialized. There are two further keyword arguments here, `n_factors` and `negative_samples`. In the former case, `n_factors` refers to the size of the latent factor space encoded by the model. The larger the number, the more expressive the model -- to a point. In the latter case, `negative_samples` configures the sampling pointwise sampling policy outlined by [He et al](). In practice, the model will be trained by sampling 'negative' instances for each positive instance in the set. In other words: for each user-item pair with a positive rating (in this case one -- remember `utils.as_implicit`?), a given number of `negative_samples` will be drawn that the user _did not_ interact with. This is resampled in each epoch. This helps the model learn more general patterns, and to avoid overfitting. Empirically, it makes quite a difference over other sampling approaches. If you're interested, you should look at the [pairwise loss used in Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)]().\n",
