{"name":"Xanthus","tagline":"Neural recommendation models in Python, using Tensorflow 2.0 & Keras.","body":"Xanthus: Neural Recommendation Models in Python\r\nBuild: Unknown Code Style\r\n\r\nQuickstart | Install guide | Known issues\r\n\r\nWhat is Xanthus?\r\nXanthus is a package that provides the tools and model architectures necessary to utilise the techniques outlined in He et al's work on Neural Collaborative Filtering in your own projects. Over time, you'll find work from other research finding it's way in here. The aim of this package is to make state-of-the-art research into neural recommenders accessible and ultimately ready for deployment. You might find that it's not quite there yet on that latter point, but it'll get there eventually.\r\n\r\nSound good? Great, here goes.\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\nSo you want to get straight into the code? Here's a Colab notebook just for you.\r\n\r\nYou can also find some examples of how to use Xanthus with sample datasets in this repo's docs. These include:\r\n\r\nA minimal example using the Movielens (100k) dataset.\r\nAn example using the meta-data features of Xanthus on the Movielens (100k) dataset.\r\nIf you're interested in seeing the contents of this package benchmarked against the non-neural recommendation packages, you're in luck. Here's some benchmarking results for you to peruse at your leisure.","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
